# Vitest-driven development (Vitest + TDD)

This is my first approach to Test-driven development (TDD) using the testing
framework of Vite: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). This project started when I
find a video on YouTube about doing [TDD with Vite and React by Midudev
(1:58:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t9l2TwGioc). So here you can see how
I face the challenges suggested by him on his video.
